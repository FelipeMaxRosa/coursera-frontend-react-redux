Ideation Report Template
project title

1. Introduction
The idea for this project came from my desire to help my mother to have a website for her store.

2. Expected list of features
I hope to offer users who access the site a list of products that the store has available, with its price and details.
As my mother makes crochet products by hand, there are a variety of possibilities, so that customers can request quotes and answer their questions.

3. Market Research
https://www.yarn.com/
https://www.crochetaria.store/
https://www.lionbrand.com/
https://shop.crochetstores.com/
https://www.skeinsisters.com.au/yarn/

These sites have menus by category, product search, product details, product price, contact, everything I need as a reference for design and components.
